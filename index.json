description for local image patch is widely used in computer vision. While the conventional way to design local descriptor is based on expert experience and knowledge, learning-based methods for designing local descriptor become more and more popular because of their good performance and data-driven property. This paper proposes a novel data-driven method for designing binary feature descriptor, which we call receptive fields descriptor (RFD). Technically, RFD is constructed by thresholding responses of a set of receptive fields, which are selected from a large number of candidates according to their distinctiveness and correlations in a greedy way. Using two different kinds of receptive fields (namely rectangular pooling area and Gaussian pooling area) for selection, we obtain two binary descriptors RFD R and RFD G accordingly. Image matching experiments on the well-known patch data set and Oxford data set demonstrate that RFD significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art binary descriptors, and is comparable with the best float-valued descriptors at a fraction of processing time. Finally, experiments on object recognition tasks confirm that both RFD R and RFD G successfully bridge the performance gap between binary descriptors and their floating-point competitors.","tags":["Binary Features","Local Descriptor"],"title":"Receptive Fields Selection for Binary Feature Description","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Feiyun Zhu","Ying Wang","Shiming Xiang","**Bin Fan**","Chunhong Pan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1391212800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1391212800,"objectID":"5d790f7574794b19f9ad6b08ba8d98bd","permalink":"https://bfan.github.io/publication/journal-5-isprs2014/","publishdate":"2014-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-5-isprs2014/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Structured Sparse Method for Hyperspetral Unmixing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Bin Fan**","Chunlei Huo","Chunhong Pan","Qingqun Kong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1381881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1381881600,"objectID":"b57978d91b23fcc3af9d5b4c69d07231","permalink":"https://bfan.github.io/publication/journal-4-grsl2013/","publishdate":"2013-10-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-4-grsl2013/","section":"publication","summary":"Although feature-based methods have been successfully developed in the past decades for the registration of optical images, the registration of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is still a challenging problem in remote sensing. In this letter, an improved version of the scale-invariant feature transform is first proposed to obtain initial matching features from optical and SAR images. Then, the initial matching features are refined by exploring their spatial relationship. The refined feature matches are finally used for estimating registration parameters. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method.","tags":null,"title":"Registration of Optical and SAR Satellite Images by Exploring the Spatial Relationship of the Improved SIFT","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhenhua Wang","**Bin Fan**","Fuchao Wu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1378684800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1378684800,"objectID":"78a6942b4006cfbc7c6dca8c6ac347de","permalink":"https://bfan.github.io/publication/conf-5-bmvc2013/","publishdate":"2013-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conf-5-bmvc2013/","section":"publication","summary":"***BMVC 2013***","tags":["Local Feature","Feature Descriptor","Image Matching"],"title":"FRIF: Fast Robust Invariant Feature","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Bin Fan**","Qingqun Kong","Xiaotong Yuan","Zhiheng Wang","Chunhong Pan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1369526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1369526400,"objectID":"aa00ab88f9e0d13d7247fc0568fd8698","permalink":"https://bfan.github.io/publication/conf-6-icassp2013/","publishdate":"2013-05-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conf-6-icassp2013/","section":"publication","summary":"***ICASSP 2013***","tags":["Local Feature","Feature Descriptor","Image Matching"],"title":"Learning Weighted Hamming Distance for Binary Descriptors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Bin Fan**","Fuchao Wu","Zhanyi Hu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1349049600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1349049600,"objectID":"d90972b1b2c28fa9aa571dff723e97d0","permalink":"https://bfan.github.io/publication/journal-3-tpami2012/","publishdate":"2012-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-3-tpami2012/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes a novel method for interest region description which pools local features based on their intensity orders in multiple support regions. Pooling by intensity orders is not only invariant to rotation and monotonic intensity changes, but also encodes ordinal information into a descriptor. Two kinds of local features are used in this paper, one based on gradients and the other on intensities; hence, two descriptors are obtained: the Multisupport Region Order-Based Gradient Histogram (MROGH) and the Multisupport Region Rotation and Intensity Monotonic Invariant Descriptor (MRRID). Thanks to the intensity order pooling scheme, the two descriptors are rotation invariant without estimating a reference orientation, which appears to be a major error source for most of the existing methods, such as Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), SURF, and DAISY. Promising experimental results on image matching and object recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed descriptors compared to state-of-the-art descriptors.","tags":["Local Features","Intensity Order Pooling","Image Matching","Feature Descriptors"],"title":"Rotationally Invariant Descriptors using Intensity Order Pooling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Bin Fan**","Fuchao Wu","Zhanyi Hu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1328054400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1328054400,"objectID":"29e142cc56959cc9187aa88b8070a50e","permalink":"https://bfan.github.io/publication/journal-2-pr2012/","publishdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-2-pr2012/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Line Matching","Image Matching","Line-point Invariants","Geometric Invariants"],"title":"Robust Line Matching through Line-point Invariants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhenhua Wang","**Bin Fan**","Fuchao Wu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1320537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1320537600,"objectID":"c7c39974c9ed2ceb43f1de061378b919","permalink":"https://bfan.github.io/publication/conf-4-iccv2011/","publishdate":"2011-11-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conf-4-iccv2011/","section":"publication","summary":"***ICCV 2011***","tags":["Local Feature","Feature Descriptor","Image Matching"],"title":"Local Intensity Order Pattern for Feature Description","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Bin Fan**","Fuchao Wu","Zhanyi Hu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1317427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1317427200,"objectID":"c18b57a03a15ed2e48a098955f4a748c","permalink":"https://bfan.github.io/publication/journal-1-prl2011/","publishdate":"2011-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-1-prl2011/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Local Feature","Image Matching","Geometric Consistency"],"title":"Towards Reliable Matching of Images Containing Repetitive Patterns","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Bin Fan**","Fuchao Wu","Zhanyi Hu"],"categories":["select"],"content":"","date":1308931200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1308931200,"objectID":"a7ff62016d0135de56b59a8ec361e67c","permalink":"https://bfan.github.io/publication/conf-3-cvpr2011/","publishdate":"2011-06-25T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/conf-3-cvpr2011/","section":"publication","summary":"***CVPR 2011***","tags":["Local Feature","Feature Descriptor","Image Matching"],"title":"Aggregating Gradient Distributions into Intensity Orders: A Novel Local Image Descriptor","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Bin Fan**","Fuchao Wu","Zhanyi Hu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1276358400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1276358400,"objectID":"129172213197be6b363e476c3da0d0bf","permalink":"https://bfan.github.io/publication/conf-2-cvpr2010/","publishdate":"2010-06-13T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/conf-2-cvpr2010/","section":"publication","summary":"***CVPR 2010***","tags":["Image Matching","Line Matching","Affine Invariant"],"title":"Line matching leveraged by point correspondences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Bin Fan**","Zhen Lei","Stan Z.
