After got his doctoral degree, he has been worked in the NLPR, firstly as an Assistant Professor and now as an Associate Professor. During 2015-2016, he visited the CVLab at EPFL, working with Prof. Pascal Fua.\nBin Fan has wide research interests in Computer Vision. Previously, his research is mainly focused local invariant feature, which is fundamental for many applications, such as image classification, 3D reconstruction, object recognition. He has published over 40 scientific papers in highly ranked conferences and journals in the field, including T-PAMI, T-IP, PR, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, AAAI. He serves as an Associate Editor of Neurocomputing and regular reviewer for top-ranking journals as well as on program committee member for major vision conferences. He is a Senior member of IEEE since 2016, and a recipient of ACM Beijing Rising Star Award in 2017.\n[Email: bin.fan@ieee.org] [\rMy Google Scholar]\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://bfan.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Bin Fan received his B.E. degree from Beijing University of Chemical Technology (BUCT) in 2006, and Ph.D. degree from the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) in 2011 under supervision of Prof.","tags":null,"title":"Bin Fan","type":"authors"},{"authors":["Bin Fan","Qingqun Kong","Baoqian Zhang","Hongmin Liu","Chunhong Pan","Jiwen Lu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583020800,"objectID":"e957a4dd49e0fea31d96bf9074fa70de","permalink":"https://bfan.github.io/publication/3-pr2020/","publishdate":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/3-pr2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Large Scale Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search","Feature Matching","Binary Features","KDTree","Locality Preserving Projection"],"title":"Efficient Nearest Neighbor Search in High Dimensional Hamming Space","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yongcheng Liu","**Bin Fan***","Shiming Xiang","Chunhong Pan","*****: Corresponding author"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560614400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560614400,"objectID":"52afd1255a9bbdbf8ad01bcaa1640625","permalink":"https://bfan.github.io/publication/4-cvpr2019-rscnn/","publishdate":"2019-06-16T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/4-cvpr2019-rscnn/","section":"publication","summary":"***CVPR 2019*** ***Oral \u0026 Best Paper Finalist*** ***(CCF A)***","tags":["3D Point Cloud Processing","Deep Learning","Convolutional Neural Networks","Geometric Relation Learning"],"title":"Relation-Shape Convolutional Neural Network for Point Cloud Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yurun Tian","Xin Yu","**Bin Fan***","Fuchao Wu","Huub Heijnen","Vassileios Balntas*","Chunhong Pan","*****: Corresponding author"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560614400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560614400,"objectID":"120ed1cd0b3a1ae291f572086c7cad11","permalink":"https://bfan.github.io/publication/5-cvpr2019-sosnet/","publishdate":"2019-06-16T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/5-cvpr2019-sosnet/","section":"publication","summary":"***CVPR 2019*** ***Oral*** ***(CCF A)***","tags":["Feature Descriptor","Deep Learning","Image Matching"],"title":"SOSNet: Second Order Similarity Regularization for Local Descriptor Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hongmin Liu","Qianqian Zhang","Bin Fan*","Zhiheng Wang","Junwei Han",""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"1dacc57db504063daac5f4f1c33796c7","permalink":"https://bfan.github.io/publication/1-tcsvt2020/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/1-tcsvt2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Binary Features","Local Descriptor"],"title":"Features Combined Binary Descriptor based on Voted Ring-sampling pattern","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liang Yan","**Bin Fan***","Shiming Xiang","Chunhong Pan","*****: Corresponding author"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"dd5cae1b802820bbfee05569ab961c42","permalink":"https://bfan.github.io/publication/2-tgrs2020/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2-tgrs2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Semantic Segmentation","Adversarial Learning","Domain Adaptation"],"title":"Triplet Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Pixel-level Classification of VHR Remote Sensing Images","type":"publication"}]
